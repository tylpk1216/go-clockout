# go-clockout
If we don't know the time of clocking in today, we can use this tool to calculate the time to clock out.

Everyday I go to work, and press button to turn on my computer. So I use this start time to calculate the time that I can clock out.

On Windows, we can easyily use the event of ID 12 to get the start time.
